Raspberry Pi Sense HAT clock

This code appears on many "Pi Sense HAT clock" pages. 
The Geek Pub page (https://www.thegeekpub.com/13751/sense-hat-clock-for-the-raspberry-pi/) 
implies it is original there, but I doubt it because it appears elsewhere with earlier
dates, explanations, and correct indentation.
Given the code's ubiquity, I don't feel particularly guilty about using it.
